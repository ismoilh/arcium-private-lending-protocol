# Arcium Private Lending Protocol

A private lending and borrowing protocol built with NestJS that integrates Arcium's encrypted compute capabilities for secure financial transactions on Solana.

## üîê Features

### Core Features
- **Encrypted Compute Integration**: Leverages Arcium's MPC network for secure parameter processing
- **Private Lending**: Borrow and lend with encrypted sensitive data
- **Solana Integration**: Built on Solana blockchain for fast, low-cost transactions
- **Risk Assessment**: Advanced ML-powered risk evaluation using encrypted compute
- **Secure Transactions**: All sensitive data is encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- **RESTful API**: Complete API documentation with Swagger
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed codebase for better development experience

### Advanced Features
- **Database Persistence**: PostgreSQL with TypeORM for robust data management
- **User Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Advanced Risk Models**: Machine learning-powered risk assessment with multiple factors
- **Multi-Token Support**: Support for multiple SPL tokens and token management
- **Automated Liquidation**: Smart liquidation system for undercollateralized loans
- **Governance System**: Decentralized governance for protocol parameter management
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Real-time metrics, logging, and performance monitoring
- **Security Features**: Helmet, compression, rate limiting, and comprehensive validation

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL 13+
- Redis 6+ (optional, for caching)
- Solana CLI (for development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd arcium-private-lending
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

4. Set up the database:
